## ReadME

My intention for this project was to solve a problem for myself. 
I wanted to switch to spotify but had over 5000 songs to transfer and 55+ playlists. 
That would haven taken me weeks of tedious work to do. 
This app is my solution. 

This app could be FAR more protable and user friendly. 
However, portability was not my main focus. 

I am not happily a spotify user with all of my music. 

There is some setup require to run to associate the spotify and apple music accounts.
A few assumptions are made about the user's system. 

Compile the AppleScripts:
```
osacompile -o exportApplePlaylist.scpt exportApplePlaylist.applescript

osacompile -o createApplePlaylist.scpt createApplePlaylist.applescript
```
